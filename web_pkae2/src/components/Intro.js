                    Hi there! I'm Pkae2, a U.S. freelance artist focused on anime style illustrations and 2D models. <br/> <br/>
                    I have an engineering background but am now focused on creating and growing a business off my art. <br/> <br/>
                    I'd love to meet and make friends with you all at any of my socials below!
